The project includes the following files:

'README.md': This file.
'run_analysis.R': R script for performing the analysis.
'tidy_data_set.txt': Tidy data set file.
'code_book.txt': Code book describing the variables in the tidy data set file.
 Script run_analysis.R

 Install the packages "reshape2" before running the script. The script is written in 5 steps described in the project instruction. The script writes the final tidy data set to a text file. The tidy data set is the return value of the function.
