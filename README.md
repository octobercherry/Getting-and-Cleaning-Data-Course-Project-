# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-
The project includes the following files:

'README.md': This file.

'run_analysis.R': R script for performing the analysis.

'code_book.md': Code book describing the variables in the tidy data set file.

## Script run_analysis.R

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

I have created an R script named run_analysis.R that performs the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
